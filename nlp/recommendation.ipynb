            "release script release tool for npm and bower packages build status description with this tool there is no need to keep transpiled lib build or distr files in the git repo because bower keeps its files in the github repo this tools helps to deal with that too just create new additional github repo for bower version of your project this repo will contain only commits generated by this tool say the name of your project is original project name then name the bower github repo as original project name bower add 'release script' bowerrepo into your package json then add additional step into your building process which will create bower package files in the amd folder basically it is just a process of copying the lib files readme and license and that's all now release script will do all those steps described next including bower publishing for you automatically initial idea is got from react bootstrap release tools tools release that have been written by matt smith mtscout kind of migration manual documentation pages publishing if your project generates static documentation pages as react boostrap does and needs publishing them to a standalone repo via git push just create additional github repo for the documentation pages e g react bootstrap github io git add it as 'release script' docsrepo into your package json default folders for documentation pages are docsroot docs built folder where the files will be built to by your custom building script tmpdocsrepo tmp docs repo temporary folder for the release script usage it is advised to add them both into gitignore you can customize them as you need if you need to publish only documentation pages say with some minor fixes you can do it this way in this case the package json version will be bumped with preid docs as docs if npm run docs build script is present then it will be used instead of npm run build script note documentation pages are not published when you are releasing pre release version i e when you run it with preid option pre release versions publishing say you need to publish pre release v pre version with the canary npm tag name instead of default one latest you can do it this way if your preid tag and npm tag are the same then you can just it will produce v beta and npm publish tag beta changelog generated output will go into changelog alpha md for pre releases and with the next release this file will be removed alternative npm package root folder say you want to publish the content of your lib folder as an npm package's root folder then you can do it as simple as adding the following to your package json and that's all the special case build step in tests step if you run building scripts within your npm run test step e g then you can prevent npm run build step from running by setting 'release script' skipbuildstep option options all options for this package are kept under 'release script' node in your project's package json bowerrepo the full url to github project for the bower pkg files bowerroot the folder name where your npm run build command will put transpile files for bower pkg default value 'amd' tmpbowerrepo the folder name for temporary files for bower pkg default value 'tmp bower repo' altpkgrootfolder the folder name for alternative npm package's root folder it is advised to add bowerroot and tmpbowerrepo folders to your gitignore file example github releases if you need this script to publish github releases you can generate a github token at and put it to env github token this way or into your shell scripts you can set a custom message for github release via notes cli option if you need dry run mode by default you can setup the release script to run in dry run mode by default it can be done by setting true the defaultdryrun option in your package json then to actually run your commands you will have to add run this script does the following steps ensures that git repo has no pending changes ensures that the latest version is fetched checks linting and tests by running npm run test command does version bumping builds all by running npm run build command if there is no build script then release script just skips the build step if one of rf mt changelog is used in 'devdependencies' then changelog is to be generated adds and commits package json with changed version and changelog md if it's used adds git tag with new version and changelog message if it's used pushes changes to github repo if github token is present the script publishes the release to the github if preid tag set then npm publish tag command for npm publishing is used with tag option one can set npm tag name for a pre release version e g alpha or canary otherwise preid value will be used if altpkgrootfolder isn't set it will just npm publish tag as usual otherwise the release script will npm publish tag from the inside altpkgrootfolder folder scripts and devdependencies will be removed from package json if bowerrepo field is present in the package json then bower package will be released the script will clone the bower repo to the tmpbowerrepo folder clean up all files but git in the tmpbowerrepo folder copy all files from bowerroot to tmpbowerrepo they has to be generated by npm run build add all files to the temporary git repo with git add a then it will commit tag and push the same as for the npm package and at the end it will remove the tmpbowerrepo folder if docsrepo option is set then documentation pages are being pushed to their repo it is done the same way as bower publishing process if only docs command line option is set then github npm and bower publishing steps will be skipped installation if you need bower releases too then add 'release script' bowerrepo into your package json if you have smth like that in your shell or you had installed release script globally via npm install g release script then you can release your new versions this way otherwise you need to type in the commands this way you can as well add some helpful script commands to your package json and you can add it like this this way it became possible to run it like that notice you have to add additional double slash before any option this way additional options get through to release script license release script is licensed under the mit license\n",

with github and npm it use the github new feature github actions to achive this this project is inspired by github octicon and feather icon thanks for these two amazing repository also you can learn more about how github use figma's api to handoff octicon how it works imgs flow en jpg this workflow is a bit complex but most can run itself automatically you only need to configure it once and enjoy many times later there are six steps here create components at first you should create a file which contains your icons' components this workflow only fetch components create pull request in plugin fill in the github repository url and token to push your updates to github which can create a pull request for you merge pr trigger actions now you can merge this pr which will trigger the github actions workflow process and convert svg code github actions will fetch figma components's svg code through figma's api and process it after it github actions will convert them into react component code generate github pages for icon showcase github actions will also generate github pages code to showcase your icons online you can change the code in sample repositories publish to npm finally it'll publish processed code to npm install or update from npm developers can use them through terminal execution which is familiar to them usage pre requirements at first you need a github account then you need a npm account steps create figma file first of all you should create a figma file in which you can place your icon components here is an example file you can duplicate it to your account

waiting workflow imgs waiting workflow png click it to get more detailed information about every step workflow steps imgs workflow steps png completed install or upgrade the package in termianl developers can run npm add your package name in terminal to install the package or run npm update your package name to upgrade the package instead they can also run yarn add your package name or yarn upgrade your package name if yarn is used yarn add imgs yarn add png the magic moment is coming developers can import these icons into their react project and it works use in code imgs use in code png attentions we have two icon styles stroke and fill please make sure each icon only conatins one style don't mix them tip you can use figma's outline stroke to convert stroked icon into filled icon icons with suffix fill will be converted into filled component code and the one with suffix stroke will be converted into stroked component code default style is defined in config style in package

modules description atomify provides a centralized point of access to atomify js and atomify css both in code and on the command line it also offers a server with live reload and on the fly bundling support to make development a breeze examples you can learn from examples in this repository api atomify opts cb just like its constituent pieces atomify is a function that takes an opts object and a callback function opts opts js options to be passed to atomify js opts css options to be passed to atomify css opts assets used to configure opts js assets and opts css assets simultaneously and identically see links above opts server options to be passed to the development server callback just like the callbacks used by atomify js and atomify css but with a third parameter to denote the type of bundle being provided cb err src type where type is either 'js' or 'css' api example if you don't need to access the bundled source simply provide a file path as the output property in your options and atomify will write the file for you atomify js and atomify css as a convenience you can access atomify js and atomify css via properties on the atomify function development server atomify includes a development server that provides things like on the fly bundling and live reload browser sync support to make your workflow lightning fast atomify server opts provides basically the same api as atomify itself with a few extra options documented below added in the biggest difference of course is that instead of writing to a file or calling a callback function atomify server responds to http requests the server can also be configured by including a server property in the opts object when calling atomify opts just like with atomify the options passed to atomify server are expected to have a js and or css field when the entry option of either of these is requested the server will return the results of bundling your code if you don't want to include the actual path to your entry file in your html you can also provide an alias option field when the alias path is requested the server will bundle using your entry path opts server you can provide server specific options in this field opts server port port to listen on default opts server open if provided open the url in your default browser opts server path the path to open appended to by default default default which is a generated html file that includes your css and js bundles automatically opts server url full url to open instead of opts server hostname use your machine's local hostname via node's os hostname instead of localhost ideal for accessing pages from mobile devices on the same lan aliased as h opts server lr enables live reload support by injecting the live reload script into any html pages served supports the following sub properties sync use browsersync aliased as s if provided as an object will be used as the ghostmode option for browsersync port port for browsersync server to run on default patterns globbing patterns to pass to browsersync for watching default ' html' relative to process cwd as well as all files in the dependency graph of your js and css bundles quiet suppress file change notifications on the command line default false verbose log browsersync's debuginfo to the console default false opts server sync shortcut for specifying opts server lr as sync true aliased as s opts server st options to pass to st static file server which is what serves all non entry alias requests opts server html override the default html served at default pass either a filepath or a function if you pass a function you'll be passed one options argument with the urls to the bundled js and css you should insert those into your html and return a string if you pass a filepath the bundled js and css will automatically be inserted at the bottom of your file however you can place the strings atomify css and atomify js when you want the relevant paths inserted to override this behavior opts server spamode when set to true the default html will always be served this is useful for single page apps that have a router package json config in order to support atomify turtles all the way down you can also specify your configuration in package json simply recreate an opts object structure in json with atomify as the key omit output properties if not a top level package for detailed information on configuring rework plugins in package json see the relevant section of the atomify css readme cli thanks to subarg nearly everything you can do in code or json you can do on the command line js options can be specified in a js j subarg context and css options can be specified in a css c subarg context server options can be specified in a server s subarg context if you supply the debug d or output o args outside the js and css contexts they will apply to both js and css bundles when providing an output argument that applies to both omit the file extension and it will be applied correctly for you you can also configure aliases by appending them after a in your entry field like j entry js bundle js get a complete listing of options by running atomify help cli examples any top level args js css server passed on the command line will override the corresponding configuration defined in package json non conflicting top level items will be

            "npm packages the right way this repository aims to demonstrate how to build npm packages the right way my package should import the shared code built for the current environment my package server should import the server only code and maybe shared code as well my package client should import the client only code and maybe shared code as well packages should be written in typescript and expose their type definitions bonus features folders may have multiple indexes index client ts index server ts etc support common rd party tools importing in jest storybook cypress to sum it up we want to demonstrate how to build fullstack typed npm packages we take inspiration from meteor package system they provide an incredible developer experience but were sadly limited to meteor apps and suffer from a few technical issues we want to achieve the same devx with modern generic bundlers note the shared code will be exactly the same in both environment this is slightly different to what we call isomorphism isomorphism is only possible with some magic at import time basically changing my package to my package at build time in your app which is out of scope here run and test clone this repo yarn install relevant packages cd my package webpack yarn yarn run publish will build your package generate a tarball cd cd demo next app yarn yarn run dev will start a next js app that imports each package open relevant page to test the import how you can help see contribute section below you can add a demo with a new bundler rollup tsup done unbuild could be great candidates exploring tsdx how could contribute to this project which ideas we could test here improve the build for one of the bundler we cover add automated tests for the next js app using jest or cypress open an issue with ideas feedback knowledge about bundlers a feature you'd like to test etc etc add a performance benchmark automate building facilitate development learnings various formats umd used to be the way to go for having a single shared bundle but now es modules should be preferred moderne bundlers such as esbuild might not support them in webpack commonjs seems to do something similar to umd es modules will be the reference in the short run npm packages npm exports will be the reference in the short run but need better support in typescript need better support in jest should be shipped in jest typescript typescript doesn't support multi entry exports correctly at the time of writing see this article for a hackish but brilliant solution to bypass this issue see stack overflow question for all bundlers that do not support generating d ts you can simply use tsc emitdeclarationonly declaration to generate the type definitions generating such files needs typescript it's not yet possible to create them more quickly without rewriting typescript they will account for most of the build time when using esbuild or swc half of the build time very roughly can vary for a webpack project you must not alter the file names when building otherwise your definition files won't match see there is an issue between types node and ts we locked it to in the esbuild demo see ts will transpile dynamic import leading to module not found esm packages my package esbuild client need to be imported use 'import' you need to prevent it from doing so in next js the issue can be bypassed by definining an intermdiate client only using top level import and then dynamically importing only the local component it might explain in the future tsc might be rewritten in go by the developper behind swc announced in january bringing crazy performances esmodules they are more appropriate for packages as iife because packages might be imported within an app that will in turn be built es modules will give more freedom to the app bundler while in an npm package we want to minimize the build step see setting type module in package json will apply to all exports with js extension so if you use commonjs exports for node esm for browser the node imports will break this applies to conditional exports too instead make sure that commonjs file are using cjs extension exporting node to es modules is a bad idea instead use conditionnal exports and commonjs for node code commonjs exports must end with cjs and es modules with mjs js alone is ambiguous its behaviour changes depending on the type module option of package json leading to confusing behaviour tsdx tsdx is a brillant project that helps bootstrapping npm package development it includes dev vs prod bundle with a loading based on the current node env very interesting pattern that we could use here it includes a nice support for lodash it is based on top of rollup for the build limitations it doesn't demo a monorepo and doesn't demo fullstack packages but could probably be extended to do so others typing the bundler config is often difficult because they are run at low level using node the types directive in comments might help having intellisense in vs code without actually using typescript files don't forget to drop next from time to time when working with local packages next js might cache them leading to stale imports npm and or yarn may cache tgz files in an unexpected way reinstalling a stale version everytime learning per build tools webpack works ok but slow webpack has a weird way to handle packages in lerna repo the bundle sometimes end up containing the current package imports at the moment this repo doesn't demo importing other packages or monorepo but it could useful in the future esbuild handling external is utterly painful for the server export you want to add packages such as react graphql etc as externals but there is no easy way to add all packages from package json as externals the demo works but it may still generate const react require 'react' in the esm build in some real life context while require should never appear in an esm module tsup tsup is an abstraction over esbuild it sounds more relevant for people that build packages treating node modules as externals generating d ts etc supports d ts generation but probably not d ts map which are needed for local development switching to types in vs code it might still be necessary to use tsc during dev changing the kind of built file might change the extensions be careful with that sometimes js is the commonjs sometimes the es modules this may lead to the following confusing behaviour when using cjs and esm as the the output js will be the commonjs export and mjs the es module export if you add type module to your package json the commonjs js export will actually be considered as an es module conditional exports are supposed to avoid this issue you don't need to use type module with them but may not work unbuild doesn't respect the outdir in our demo based on rollup at the time of writing there is no official doc for the config but you can write in typescript and read the source directly contribute if you want to test a new bundler copy package template and setup package json accordingly please try to modify only the package json this way we can compare bundlers against the same basic features then add a new page in the next js demo app to update a package run yarn run publish to build and pack it and rerun yarn in the next js app you may need to use npm if the package is not updated see for example npm i my package webpack this is because of a bug in yarn relative to local packages when using tarballs and relative paths you may use this package to reproduce bugs for certain bundlers in this case reproduce your bug and open a pull request we'll keep it open until the maintainers of the bundler fix the bug if you want to test a new feature exporting react components supporting path aliases or whatever you may open a pr modifying the package template we can then apply this change to all the packages using a command in the future or apply it manually references tsdx to be explored it brings a better ux to package development next js plugin rfc vulcan fullstack packages rfc ts and esm conditional exports in package blitz toolkit setup

sure also that you have php and mysql mariadb installed as well could be usefull for wordpress if you already have composer installed globally you're all set up otherwise you can install it locally in one command then you can set up your wordpress installation with composer you then have a working wordpress install with steroids theme into your my new project directory if you have downloaded

constant to true in the env file last but not least if you want to take advantage of linting from stylelint and eslint you'll have to install their respective plugins in your code editor php installing dependencies all of your work lays as usual in the theme's directory themes steroids when you need an external library or a new plugin just install it with composer composer require what you need if it's a library you just need to include the autoloader before calling a library and it'll take care of the rest if it's a plugin it's listed in the plugins in your admin dashboard and you just need to activate it steroids namespace to avoid collisions steroids uses its own namespace in its functions inc files nothing fancy here just prefix functions with steroids like so steroids function name if you need a reminder about namespace and how to use it a quick read of the official docs will set you up javascript out of the box you get esnext setup ready to use the latest features babel possibility to use commonjs esm modules with tree shaking rollup powerfull dom based routing you can load some js files on certain pages only two js builds one as an es module and the second one as a normal script this allows for best performance and compatibility with the widest range of browsers as google explains using js conditional loading you know that speed is everything for the ux and seo of your site so why load one big js file on all pages when you can target just the amount of js required on a given page that's exactly the feature unlocked by our js router the modules that you'll want to be loaded dynmically are to be placed into scripts routes then simply initialise the router telling it which modules should load on what pages under the hood conditional loading are nothing less than esmodule dynamic imports therefore they are compatible with all major browsers for those older browsers such as ie if you ever want to support them all imports will be bundled in the nomodule script main iife js that's automatically available for older browsers the only downside is that the file contains all the code as these browers don't support dynamic imports so the first download is bigger styles styles use less by default but it should be pretty straightforward to use sass instead let me know if you want to maintain a sass version in addition to offering time saving utils for responsive utilities you benefit from all the less awesomeness the real killer feature though is the conditional loading of styles you can target on which templates your styles are loading the styles directory structure is as follows utils less are the utility functions these are to be included at the top of the files that will use them critical less is the file that will immediately be linked on all pages you use it to include stylesheets that are essential on all or most pages header typography lazy less is the file that will be lazy loaded on all pages because styles are render blocking you use it to include stylesheets that are used on all or most pages but that can be parsed after initial pageload the files imported by either critical less or lazy less are to be located into critical or lazy respectively all these files will inherit the functions and variables defined in utils less so you won't need to import it before using its functions the third folder named routes contains all the files that are conditionally loaded subfolders can obviously be created to better sort your styles but files in these subfolders are compiled only if imported by files of their parent folder routes less otherwise they serve no purpose finaly to dynamically load stylesheets on a given template you'll pass the stylesheet s slug s in the shape of an array as the second parameter of the get header function get header null 'stylesheets' 'slug' for instance let's say we need to import our stylesheet styles routes blog less on our blog posts the template responsible for these blog posts is single php so the file will start like this now let's say that we also want to import a second stylesheet that is dedicated to comments creatively named comments less that's also used on product pages we'll do something like the following we might realise that comments less contains a lot of styles and that they are at the end of the article far under the fold we therefore would rather have these styles loaded asynchronously fair enough this way the blog stylesheet will load right away but the comments stylesheet will load after initial pageload note that 'lazy' false is the default and can be omitted so the following is correct and has the same effect apart from the stylesheets the options array allows you to define aditional classes you'd want to add to the html body this is very usefull for when you need to apply styles in specific areas of a given page assets pre compression css javascript and svg files are pre compressed in both brotli and gzip so that your webserver will be able to server better compressed files even faster performance junk removal this theme used to do a lot to remove junk wordpress defaults it still does a few things but in the end this is better managed by a third party plugin in addition to remove useless stylesheets javascript files and markup added by wordpress and plugins alike one thing that can really boost load times general performance is to unload plugins alltogether when they are not needed you save mysql queries php processing time and polar bears at the same time seriously a lot of plugins are of no use on most pages a form plugin running its logic loading its styles and js on every page an image optimisation plugin that isn't meant for frontend but still loads on every request wtf don't you think for that very reason i use asset cleanup pro on every site i build it allows you to unload any core theme and plugin css js site wide or on a per page basis it also allows you to completely control when a plugin executes its php code there's more it allows you to remove all useless wordpress styles assets and markup like image emojis comments rss feed etc also there is a free version that's nice too if you don't need the features of the pro version git you can initialise git with composer composer run script gitinit this will initialise a git repo with git emojis hooks contributing there's sure room for improvement so feel free to hack around and submit prs that would be cool for instance if we could have proper html emails so if you have the skills to code html emails don't hesitate to give me a helping hand please just follow the style of the existing code which is airbnb's style with minor modifications public themes steroids eslintrc to maintain things clear and visual please follow the

            "product recommender npm module contents what is product recommender about setup process setup api use recommendation engine learn analytics analysis recommendation variables vars what is product recommender product recommender is an npm module that utlizes a python machine learning recommendation engine to give easy access to customer purchase recommendations product recommender exists on the npm registry under the name product recommender this repo will have the up to date version of my python recommendation engine but if you wish to investigate the earlier development of the code please check out my python recommender github repo to express your opinions on product recommender please send an email to lramsey gmail com or submit a github issues request a demo application of product recommender named product demo currently exists on npm to check out that demo application install product demo with npm npm install product demo the algorithm in the lib folder uses unsupervised machine learning to find trends within customer purchase data the algorithm expects three inputs a list of customer names a list of products under investigation and a nested list that mentions how much of each product a customer has purchased the algorithm divides this product purchase quantity into two states whether a customer has bought a product or has not bought a product customers are divided into clusters based on similar purchase histories through a k means algorithm from these clusters the algorithm derives recommendations by comparing an individual customer's buying patterns with the average buying patterns of his or her cluster in addition k means is also used to group together products that tend to be bought together and more focused customer clusters are constructed based on these product groups to learn more about the structure of my recommendation engine please check out my blog post anatomy of a recommendation using the node js command line interface the python recommendation engine can be launched as a child process with the results streamed to node these results are divided into various variables based on the type of data they hold and a user can gain access to all this raw analysis or a user may use helper methods within product recommender to parse out desired information such as which product to recommend to a consumer setup process to utilize the product recommender npm module the first step would be to make sure one has successfully installed node js npm and a python version of or to install these items i would recommend you check out and in addition to these prerequisites there are a couple python modules that you will need to install as well these modules are numpy and jsonpickle the install process for these modules is fairly simple often just a few lines in the terminal for install instructions on numpy please go to for jsonpickle please look at some more python modules used in this project are argparse ast math and random though these should be included in the python standard library so there is likely no need to download these once all of these dependencies are installed adding the product recommender module to your node project is as simple as navigating to your project directory in the terminal and typing 'npm install product recommender' api product recommender consists of three core parts recommendation engine analytics and recommendation variables in the recommendation engine section the machine learning algorithm is run the results from this algorithm are then parsed and saved in the recommendation variables in the analytics section methods are provided that use the recommendation variables to produce desired outcomes the analytics methods do such things as finding groups of similar customer or producing a product recommendation for a customer in the recommendation variable section i give you access to the recommendation variables used by my analytics methods so you can use them however you see fit when using product recommender though the first step is to make sure you have required the module on the page you are using as an example for the rest of the readme project i will use the rec variable to represent my required module var rec require 'product recommender' the three sections are listed below pleas use these links to help in your navigation recommendation engine learn analytics analysis recommendation variables vars recommendation engine this section consists of the setrecvariables method which invokes the python recommendation engine when the algorithm has finished streaming its results to node the setrecvariables method then parses these results and assigns values to each of the recommendation variables whenever one wants a fresh reading of the recommendation engine's analysis one simply needs to run setrecvariables method again and the recommendation variables will be set to the values of the latest analysis the setrecvariables method takes four parameters any additional arguments will be added as arguments to the callback parameter rec setrecvariables history callback names products history the history argument contains either a matrix or a string that references the directory structure of a file containing a matrix a matrix is a d array each entry in the outer array contains the purchase history of an individual customer the length of the outer array is the same length as the names array below so each customer in the data set is represented in the history parameter the length of each inner array is the length of the products array below each inner array contains information on which product from the products list each customer has purchased the order of products in the inner array should match the order in the products array so each column of the d array refers to a particular product var history if the history parameter contains a file directory instead the matrix contained within that file will be read directly into the python algorithm this is necessary for data analysis on larger matrices but could be done for matrices of any size var history ' some valid directory matrix txt' callback the callback parameter consists of a custom callback function that will run after my product recommendation engine has finished streaming its results to node js the algorithm runs asynchronously so properly putting your continuing product recommender logic inside a callback function is essential to using product recommender to add arguments to the callback function include more than parameters for setrecvariables any argument beyond the fourth named parameter in the rec setrecvariables method will be added as arguments to the callback function var callback function results rec getrecvariables 'results' names the names argument consists of an array of customer names unique identifiers each element in this array should be a unique string if a names argument is not used the parameter will default to a number n which is the length of the outer array in the history paremeter nested array a names array of length n will be created and filled with random unique name strings for each index in the array var names 'steve' 'henry' 'thea' 'patrick' products the products argument consists of an array of product names unique identifiers like the names parameter each element in this array should be a unique string if a products argument is not used the parameter will default to a number n which is the same length of any of the inner arrays in the history parameter nested array a products array of length n will be created and filled with random unique product strings for each index in the array var products 'shoes' 'socks' 'shirts' 'shorts' api use analytics this grouping consists of methods that are designed to analyze the data held in the recommendation variables to produce a desired result these methods accomplish such goals as determining which cluster is most relevant to a customer's purchase of a particular product or producing a product recommendation for a customer based on recent buying patterns now i will describe the analytics functions recommender customer recmatrix this method accepts inputs of a customer string from the customer array and the optional input of a recommendation matrix the method considers the input customer's row from the recommendation matrix and pops off the product that my algorithm has determined is the strongest recommendation in that group the recommended product is returned the recommendation matrix parameter allows the more custom recommendation matrices built around buying trends in related product groups to be used instead of the default matrix if a user buys a pair of shoes he may have a certain taste in products similar to shoes that is different than his taste in other areas by placing the recommendation matrix concerned with the shoe products in the recommender method the recommendation can be fine tuned based on the reality that the user recently bought shoes with this custom matrix parameter one can choose which product group of interest one wants the recommendation tailored towards rec recommender 'steve' matrix recommendbyproduct customer product this method takes a customer string and a product string as parameters the method then determines which product group the product belongs to and accesses the proper recommendation matrix based on that product group this custom recommendation matrix is then used to return a product more focused on the customers buying patterns in relation the input product rec recommendbyproduct 'steve' 'shoes' powerrecommendation customer this method creates a recommendation for a particular customer based on the rec powerrecmatrix recommendation variable this matrix only contains results from clusters with a higher silhouette score than customerclusters the matrix weighs the best results from each power cluster and ranks them this way upon calling powerrecommendation the highest perfoming result across all the power clusters is returned rec powerrecommendation 'steve' pastcustomerrecommendations customer this method returns an object that reveals which products have been recommended to customers through the different recommendation analytics methods to check if a product has been recommended use the product's name as a key on the object if the value returned for that product key is true the product has been recommended to listed customer if the value returned is undefined the product has not been recommended yet to that customer rec pastcustomerrecommendatons 'steve' getcustomercluster customer this method accepts a customer string as a parameter and returns an array of the global customer cluster that contains that input customer these customers in the returned cluster all have similar buying patterns across all products rec getcustomercluster 'steve' getcustomerclusterbyproducts customer product this method accepts a customer string and product string as parameters and returns a cluster that is chosen based on the input customer's buying trends in relation to products similar to the input product this cluster is an array that contains customer names including the input customer rec getcustomerclustersbyproducts 'steve' 'shoes' getproductcluster product this method accepts a product string as a parameter and returns an array of products similar to the input product including the input product this returned array is the product cluster that contains the input product rec getproductcluster 'shoes' relatedcustomers customer this method accepts a customer string as a parameter and returns an array of customers with similar purchase histories based on clustering this result returns the members of that customer's global cluster group excluding the input customer to investigate more focused groups based on certain product patterns please use the the relatedcustomersbyproduct method rec relatedcustomers 'steve' relatedcustomersbyproduct customer product this method takes a customer string and product string as a parameter based on the input product a cluster is selected that reflects the customer's taste in relation to that product the method returns members of that cluster excluding the input customer these customers have similar buying patterns with the input customer in terms of products similar to the product parameter rec relatedcustomersbyproduct 'steve' 'shoes' relatedproducts product this method takes a product string as a parameter the method returns an array of products my algorithm has judged to be similar based on the aggregate purchase history of my customers the returned products are in the same product cluster as the input product excluding the input product rec relatedproducts 'shoes' nearestneighbors customer num overflow this method takes a customer string as a parameter and contains an optional num parameter that will default to if it is not included as an argument the optional overflow parameter defaults to true the method reveals which customers are the lowest distance away from the listed customer an array is returned that contains at least the num closest customers to the listed customer the array is ordered so customers at a lower index are either closer or the same distance away as customers at a higher index the array may be greater than length num if when index num has been reached there is a tie to who is the closest customer if the overflow parameter is set to false then the array will be limited to length num even in the case of ties rec nearestneighbors 'steve' false nearestneighborhoods customer num this method takes a customer string as a parameter and takes an optional num parameter which will default to if not included this method returns an ordered array that shows the num closest relative distances different customers are from the listed customer along with the customers who are that distance away the customermatrix is used to find this relative distance each entry in the returned array is an object with a single key referring to a distance the corresponding value for that distance key is an array filled with all customers who are that distance away from the listed customer rec nearestneighborhoops 'steve' nearestproducts product num overflow this method takes a product string as well as optional nums and overflow paremeters the method behaves similarly to nearestneighbors but instead of finding the closest customers to a particular customers it finds the products most similar to the listed product rec nearestproducts 'shoes' nearestproductneighborhoods product num this method takes a product string and an optional num parameter this method behaves similarly to the nearestneighborhoods method but instead of searching for the closest customers to a listed customer it looks for the closest products to a listed product rec nearestproductneighborhoods 'shoes' api use recommendation variables the recommendation variables hold the fine grained results from my product recommendation algorithm these results can be accessed overall by the results variable or can be broken into various categories to access a recommendation variable one would call the getrecvariable method passing the desired variable name in as a key rec getrecvariable key to receive an array containing all of the recommendation keys one can call the getreckeys method rec getreckeys to manually set a value on a recommendation variable use the loadrecvariable method this method takes two parameterss a string that signifies the name of the recommendation variable to change and a value which will be set to that recommendation variable any value entered here to a recommendation variable could cause errors in the module if it is not the same format the recommendation variable typically would be after executing setrecvariables also altering some recommendation variables but not others could lead to outcomes that are not consistent to one set of the recommendation engine's analysis could be used to load past results from the recommendation engine use this method with caution rec loadrecvariable key value to manually set several values on a recommendation variable use the loadrecvariables method the first parameter is an array of strings filled with the name of recommendation variables to change the second parameter is an array of values which to assign to the previous mentioned recommendation variables the value that is in the same index as the recommendation variable name in the key array will be assigned to that recommendation variable if the key and value arrays are of different lengths the code will throw an error could be used to load past results from the recommendation engine again use with caution rec loadrecvariables keys values initially the recommendation variables will be set to null until a call is made to launch the python recommendation engine now i will describe the recommendation variables results an array containing all of the below recommendation variables except for rawresults rawresults an array containing the raw results sent from my product recommendation algorithm customers an array containing the name string of every customer the order of customers in this array matches the customer order in the succeeding matrices products an array containing the name string of every product the order of products in this array matches the product order in the history matrix purchasehistory a nested array containing the raw purchase history nested array passed in as a parameter to the setrecvariables method each index in the outer array refers to a customer and each index in the inner array refers to how much of a particular product a customer bought haspurchased a nested array containing a normalized version of the history array passed in as a parameter to the setrecvariables method for every integer greater than in the nested array that value will be set to one this matrix serves as a boolean indicator on whether a customer has bought a product or not this matrix is used in my product recommendaton analysis whereas the history matrix is not customersmap an object that contains each customer's string name as keys with corresponding values referring to which index that string is stored in the customers array and various matrices productsmap an object that contains each product's string name as keys with corresponding values referring to which index that string is stored in the products array and history matrix productclusters a nested array structure each array refers to a grouping of products that the product recommendation algorithm has determined are similar based on aggregate customer buying patterns productclustersmap an object that takes a product as a key the corresponding value would be the index one can use in the productclusters array to find the group of products most similar to the input product customermatrix a nested array that describes how relatively far away each of the customers are from each other each row shows how close a particular customer is to all the other customers each index in the inner array compares how close that customer is to the customer referenced in the outer array index a value of will occur if the inner array customer and outer array customer are the same a value of will be assigned to the inner index customer closest to the outer index customer a value of wil be assigned to the outer customer farthest from the inner customer all other customers will be scaled between and based on their relative distance productmatrix like the customermatrix above except here the nested array structure concerns itself with how far away the products are from each other customerclusters a nested array structure each array refers to a grouping of customers based on similar purchase trends based on the total product set recommendationmatrix a nested array that organizes customer recommendations based on the groupings listed in the customerclusters variable these recommendations are ordered so the last product in each inner array is the product my algorithm has determined is the best product to recommend based on the customerclusters also these products contain metadata customerclusterhelpers an array of seven useful tools in relation to the customerclusters i will describe each element by its index in the array index contains the customerclusters index contains an array of centroid values for each cluster where centroid refers to the average purchase trends of every customer within a group index contains a clustermap object that contains a key of customer names and a corresponding number referring to which cluster that customer is in that number refers to the index of a particular cluster in the customerclusters array index contains an indexmap object that contains a key of a customer name and a corresponding number that refers to what index inside that customer's cluster the customer name currently lies index contains an array of silhouettes a silhouette is a number between and that represents how much closer members of a cluster are with their own cluster center in comparison to the cluster center of the next closest cluster the closer the silhouette is to the stronger the clusters each silhouette score refers to a grouping in the customerclusters array and the order is the same as the order in that array index contains an average of all the cluster silhouettes in index this serves as a rough indicator of the strength of all the clustering in customerclusters index contains the recommendationmatrix that is built up based on the customerclusters this presents ordered product recommendations for each customer with the last element of each customer array referring to the product my algorithm most highly recommends based on the customercluster subclusters an array containing all the more focused customer clustering that is determined by the product groupings found in productclusters customers in these subclusters are grouped with other customers based on their similar buying patterns in relation to these smaller product groups subclustershelpers an array containing a series of element arrays similar to the customerclusterhelpers but with various subclusters replacing the customerclusters each element in the subclusters array will have its own subclusterhelper powerclusters an array of that contains elements from the subclusters but has removed subclusters with a relatively low average silhouette score powerclustershelpers similar to subclusterhelpers but containing elements from the powerclusters array powerrecmatrix a recommendation matrix built by compiling together the results from the powerclusters only recommendation clusters that have a silhouette score higher than than the score associated with customerclusters are included the strongest elements from each type of cluster are weighted by silhouette scores and ordered by recommendation strength pastrecommendations an

            "build status coverage status local npm is a node server that acts as a local npm registry it serves modules caches them and updates them whenever they change basically it's a local mirror but without having to replicate the entire npm registry this allows your npm install commands to mostly work offline also they get faster and faster over time as commonly installed modules are aggressively cached introduction introduction usage usage listening for events listening for events command line options command line options browser ui browser ui switching with npmrc switching with npmrc speed test speed test how it works how it works using with docker using with docker introduction local npm acts as a proxy between you and the main npm registry you run npm install commands like normal but under the hood all requests are sent through the local server when you first npm install a module it'll be fetched from the main npm registry after that the module and all its dependencies at that version are stored in a local database so you can expect subsequent installs to be much faster the server will also listen for changes from the remote registry so you can expect updates to a module's metadata to be replicated within seconds of being published i e you won't get stuck with old versions if you're organizing a conference meetup whatever you can also share this local server with multiple people so if your teammates are constantly installing the same modules over and over again this can save a lot of time in the long run local npm is also a good way to make npm install work offline assuming new versions of a package haven't been published since you last installed subsequent npm install s will all serve from the cache without ever hitting a remote server addy osmani has a nice post comparing local npm to other options usage if you're using os x take a look at local npm launch agent a one liner that sets everything up automatically otherwise npm install g local npm then local npm to start the server note that it will write files in whatever directory you run it from then set npm to point to the local server npm set registry to switch back you can do npm set registry the same rules as for the npm australia mirror apply here listening for events to listen to process level events to collecting metrics use the global event emitter to introspect on these events can be one of the following info warn missed cached request command line options protip you can replicate from your friend's local npm to your own local npm by simply pointing at it while your friend does in this way you can create a daisy chain of awesome protip if you want to set up a single local npm for multiple people to use such as for conferences or workplaces then just daemonize it e g using forever and then when you run it specify the url that clients will use to access the server e g this will ensure that clients fetch tarballs from x x instead of if you want a gui or don't want to run it from the command line is an electron app for that local npm daemon browser ui a rudimentary npm like ui that allows you to search modules and see their descriptions can be found at main package main png assets main png package png assets package png if you haven't finished replicating the remote skimdb then not all the modules will be visible yet switching with npmrc features like npm search are currently unsupported so to avoid having to remember urls when switching back and forth you can use npmrc like so based on the instructions for the australian mirror of npm npm install g npmrc npmrc c local npm set registry then to search npmrc default and to switch back npmrc local incidentally though local npm does allow you to do npm login and npm publish these commands will just be proxied to the main npm registry speed test for a speed test of local npm versus regular npm see these results how it works npm is built on top of couchdb so local npm works by replicating the full skimdb database to a local pouchdb server you can inspect the running database at don't write to it the entire skimdb metadata is replicated locally but for the fullfatdb metadata plus tarballs only what you npm install is stored to start from scratch just delete whatever directory you started the server in couchdb has a changes feed so local npm just listens to the skimdb changes to know when it needs to refresh an outdated module changes should replicate within a few seconds of being published you can watch this happen in realtime by reading the logs which is kind of fun an update comes in whenever someone publishes a module note that new tarballs aren't downloaded until you explicitly npm install them though so e g if you install v of a package then v is published and your range says then the next npm install will fail unless you're online and can fetch the new tarball using with docker using local npm with docker can help speed up build times during development the awkward way to use this would be something like running services inside of a docker build command isn't really docker's business the friendly scenario works better in this case i e you run local npm on the host machine and adding the npm registry proxy commands to your dockerfile\n",

            "nodist join the chat at a node js and npm version manager for the windows folks out there inspired by n and nodenv heads up nodist v is here nodist supports cmd powershell git bash and cygwin see usage usage known issues please read this over the past months several problems have presented themselves which are due to the way nodist works and are hard to fix process signals nodist employs a wrapper executable to shim the functionality of node since windows doesn't have signals sending a sigterm or similar will probably not be propagated to the actual node process but get stuck in the shim see native modules since the node version changes at the mercy of the shim executable based on env vars target directory and the global setting and availability of node versions it is possible that locally or globally installed node modules that depend on a specific version of node usually native modules and downloaders stop working npm rebuild makes things work again in these cases installation nodist was designed to replace any existing node js installation so if node is already installed on your machine uninstall it first with the installer download the installer from the releases page run the installer and follow the install wizard via chocolatey for this you'll need chocolatey of course choco install nodist activating nodist in git bash git bash integration is setup automatically activating nodist in cygwin before you are able to use nodist in cygwin you need to run the following in your cygwin terminal after installing nodist activating nodist in powershell you might need to 'unblock' the file bin nodist ps by right clicking on it in the explorer and selecting that menu entry if you cannot see the unblock option after right clicking properties in explorer you can also perform the unblock via the following powershell command if you still cannot run nodist you may also need amend your executionpolicy setting warning please ensure you understand the risks associated with the different execution policies by first reviewing about execution policies microsoft docs make it work in your ide if your ide cannot access node or npm right away don't fret find the relevant configuration settings and either set path to nodist bin as the node installation dir or set path to nodist bin node exe as the path to the node binary directly similar for npm either set nodist bin as the installation path or nodist bin npm cmd directly some ides eg webstorm require you to set the path to an npm package containing bin npm cli js nodist comes with a proxy npm folder simply set nodist npm as the npm package this feature is experimental and feedback is appreciated migrating from or lower if you're looking to upgrade your nodist installation the easiest way is to uninstall see below the old installation and install the new version with the installer above you may need to reset your per directory node version settings in order for them to work in v ones set using nodist v should work fine ones set using v will not important usage changes in v starting in v nodist employs lazy version pattern evaluation this means that setting versions per env locally globally doesn't set an explicit version if you didn't give one instead the node exe shim chooses a suitable version at runtime commands for installing a version and setting a requirement have been separated thus to update your node version if your global version is set to e g you now need to run nodist i e nodist doesn't do that for you anymore which is probably how it should have worked all along uninstall v run the uninstaller either from the directory where you installed nodist or from the software control panel make sure to completely remove the nodist directory this will remove all your globally installed npm modules if you don't want that remove everything else other than nodist bin uninstall before v remove nodist bin from your path how remove the nodist prefix env var delete the nodist directory run npm config delete prefix on the command prompt to restore npm functionality if you are going back to the official node install usage nodist allows you to set version requirements for different scopes version requirements can be fully specified versions like or patterns like x or latest io js is supported natively since node and io js versions form a continuum you can simply use io js versions as if they were node versions setting a requirement installs a matching version only if there is no other matching version already installed otherwise existing installed versions will get referenced when executing node exe scope precedence the following is a list of all scopes ordered by precedence the first scope is the one with the highest priority only if it's not set the second scope is examined environment nodist node version and nodist npm version env vars optional package package json with an engines field in the directory of interest or one of its parent directories directory node version or npm version in the directory of interest or one of its parent directories global globally set node or npm version when you're just running node the directory of interest is the directory of the javascript file to be executed when running npm it is the current working directory package json inspection is turned off by default as of nodist v you can turn it on by setting nodist inspect packagejson npm any instances of node invoked by npm will be locked to the same version npm runs on currently all node and npm versions share the same global npm module space if you have installed native modules globally or locally you may have to run npm rebuild after changing the node version implicitly or explicitly there is an open issue about how to avoid rebuilding globally installed native modules feedback input is welcome commands all commands automatically install the latest matching version before setting the version pattern settings details node executables are stored in nodist prefix v and nodist prefix v x npm versions in nodist prefix npmv the global node exe is a shim and chooses the right node version to run based on the various version settings the same applies for npm as the global node version will be subject to change nodist comes with its own dedicated node binary got ideas doesn't work for you want to give feedback file an issue and tell me what you'd change or add or what doesn't work for you every issue is welcome malware warnings nodist is not a virus nonetheless some malware detection tools report the nodist installer as a virus if this happens please contact the vendor of your malware detection tool and report the nodist installer as a false positive debugging to see all debug messages set the debug env var before running nodist or node as follows testing the default test suite can be ran using npm testing also accepts env variables for using a mirror to download from as well as setting a proxy building building nodist requires go for compiling the shim nsis v for compiling the installer use the large strings build to avoid errors when manipulating path nsis plugin accesscontrol node js for running the build script and npm for installing nodist's dependencies finally you need to go get github com marcelklehr semver github com computes go debug if you have met all requirements run the build command afterwards you'll find the installer in build out nodistsetup exe and fully prepared installation folder in build out staging you could zip this for example the

stability locked based on node wheezy about essentially this is just a set of shell scripts that manage a node js docker image the docker image includes a script run as user that allows commands to write files as either the current user or the owner group of the current directory which the shell scripts take advantage of to make sure files are created with your preferred permissions rather than root images wrapper scripts the images contain the latest stable bower generate md grunt gulp node npm npx and yarn binaries for node when using the shell scripts available in the source repository the current directory is mounted into src inside the container and a wrapper script executes the specified command as a user who's uid and gid matches those properties on that directory this way any output is written as the directory owner group instead of root or a random user the included run as user script has three methods of determining which uid and gid to execute as by default it will execute with a uid and gid that matches the current directory the one that gets mounted into src in order to take advantage of public key authentication when installing packages from private repositories all the wrapper scripts will attempt to mount your ssh directory into the container when that is successful the script will run as the uid and gid of the owner of ssh you most software that takes advantage of public key authentication protocols do so over ssh and by default send the current user name as the login name because this process is executing out of a segregated container it knows nothing about the current user's name and will instead try to login as a user named dev in order to work around this you need to create a ssh configuration that specifies the correct username in your ssh folder create a file called config in that file you need to specify the correct username for example to specify your login name for all hosts you can easily be more explicit as well specifying by host or with additional wildcards google is your friend you can also explicitly specify the uid and gid to use at runtime by defining the puid and pgid environment variables when executing the container this is quite useful in automated build systems the included wrapper scripts default to the latest node version and image tag i feel is stable i will update the default tag as updates are released or stability issues warrant node alpine at the moment to specify a different image you can define the image tag in your environment which will set a new default you probably want to define this in your bashrc or similar profile script or you can easily specify it at runtime whenever necessary for example if you would to see like additional node modules and or wrapper scripts added to this project please feel free to create an issue or open a pull request installation this assumes that you already have docker installed a running docker daemon is required you probably want to be able to run docker commands without sudo but even if you excute the scripts with sudo files will be written with the appropriate uid and gid wrapper scripts for several commands are available in the source repository bower generate md grunt gulp node npm npx yarn installation is just a matter of putting them somewhere in your path and making them executable an installation script is available and can be executed with a shell curl sh s command simply pass in your command arguments normally updating command self update each of the scripts have a self update command which pulls down the latest docker image which all the scripts share and then updates the shell script itself if you don't have write permissions on the shell script you'll get a permissions error you can run the self

devops workflows easily implement in your continuous integration or continuous delivery pipeline this project provides two ways of running audits locally in your own environment or remotely via foo's automated lighthouse check api for basic usage running locally will suffice but if you'd like to maintain a historical record of lighthouse audits and utilize other features you can run audits remotely by following the steps and examples foo api usage features simple usage basic usage only one parameter required run multiple lighthouse audits with one command optionally run lighthouse remotely and save audits with the foo's automated lighthouse check api optionally save an html report locally saving reports locally optionally save an html report in an aws s bucket saving reports to s easy setup with slack webhooks implementing with slack just add your webhook url and lighthouse check will send results and optionally include versioning data like branch author pr etc typically from github pr comments of audit scores npm module for programmatic usage basic usage cli see cli usage cli usage docker see docker usage docker support for implementations like circleci implementing with circleci table of contents install install usage usage basic usage basic usage foo's automated lighthouse check api usage foos automated lighthouse check api usage saving reports locally saving reports locally saving reports to s saving reports to s implementing with slack implementing with slack enabling pr comments enabling pr comments enforcing minimum scores enforcing minimum scores implementing with circleci implementing with circleci implementing with github actions implementing with github actions cli cli docker docker options options install usage foo software lighthouse check provides several functionalities beyond standard lighthouse audits it's recommended to start with a basic implementation and expand on it as needed basic usage calling lighthousecheck will run lighthouse audits against and or via cli the cli will log the results foo's automated lighthouse check api usage foo's automated lighthouse check can monitor your website's quality by running audits automatically it can provide a historical record of audits over time to track progression and degradation of website quality create a free account to get started with this not only will you have automatic audits but also any that you trigger additionally below are steps to trigger audits on urls that you've created in your account trigger audits on all pages in an account navigate to your account details click into account management and make note of the api token use the account token as the apitoken option options basic example with the cli trigger audits on only certain pages in an account navigate to your account details click into account management and make note of the api token navigate to your dashboard and once you've created urls to monitor click on the more link of the url you'd like to use from the url details screen click the edit link at the top of the page you should see an api token on this page it represents the token for this specific page not to be confused with an account api token use the account token as the apitoken option options and page token or group of page tokens as urls option options basic example with the cli you can combine usage with other options for a more advanced setup example below runs audits remotely and posts results as comments in a pr saving reports locally you may notice above we had two lines of output report and local report these values are populated when options are provided to save the report locally and to s these options are not required and can be used together or alone saving a report locally example below or via cli saving reports to s or via cli implementing with slack below is a basic slack implementation to see how you can accomplish notifications with code versioning data see the circleci example implementing with circleci ie github authors prs branches etc or via cli the below screenshot shows an advanced implementation as detailed in the circleci example implementing with circleci enabling pr comments populate prcommentaccesstoken and prcommenturl options options to enable comments on pull requests enforcing minimum scores you can use validatestatus to enforce minimum scores this could be handy in a devops workflow for example or via cli important outputdirectory value must be defined and the same in both commands implementing with circleci in the below example we run lighthouse audits on two urls save reports as artifacts deploy reports to s and send a slack notification with github info we defined environment variables like lighthouse check aws bucket in the circleci project settings this implementation utilizes a circleci orb lighthouse check orb reports are saved as artifacts upon clicking the html file artifacts we can see the full report in the example above we also uploaded reports to s why would we do this if we want to persist historical data we don't want to rely on temporary cloud storage implementing with github actions similar to the circleci implementation we can also create a workflow implementation with github actions using lighthouse check action example below github workflows test yml overriding config and option defaults you can override default config and options by specifying overridesjsonfile option contents of this overrides json file can have two possible fields options and config these two fields are eventually used by lighthouse to populate opts and config arguments respectively as illustrated in using programmatically the two objects populating this json file are merged shallowly with the default config and options example content of overridesjsonfile cli running lighthouse check in the example below will run lighthouse audits against and and output a report in the ' tmp artifacts' directory format is option example below lighthouse check status example cli options all options mirror the npm module options the only difference is that array options like urls are passed in as a comma separated string as an argument using the cli docker options lighthouse check functions accept a single configuration object lighthousecheck you can choose from two ways of running audits locally in your own environment or remotely via foo's automated lighthouse check api you can think of local runs as the default implementation for directions about how to run remotely see the foo's automated lighthouse check api usage foo api usage section we denote which options are available to a run type with the run type values of either local remote or both below are options for the exported lighthousecheck

            "node package management code along overview when using npm it is often the case that we aren't familiar with all of the code in the dependency tree building modern javascript applications relies on our ability to use the tools built for us by others as it turns out most of those tools are also built using other people's tools one package may be used in another which is used in another and another and so on using npm we download specific packages of code if those packages have dependencies the dependencies are also downloaded in a recursive manner for the purposes of our own application however we only need to know about the node packages we specifically need to get our app working we don't need to worry about what packages those packages need why because every node package includes a package json file that lists out all dependencies this file lets node know what to download when we run npm install node will download all the packages check the package json files present then download any additional packages and repeat we will see in future labs that as the number of packages increases more and more happens when we run npm install all we need to worry about though is the top level what is listed in our application's package json file in this code along we are going to practice the process of setting up a package json file we will also install an npm package or two and use their functionality in new code we write objectives practice initializing a package json file practice installing an npm package introduce how to import a package into a different javascript file getting started before we can create a package json file we'll need an project and a project folder to contain all the files for this code along we'll be building out a clock application that changes color every second in this lesson a sub folder has been created for us to use color clock that contains some basic starter files for a project if you look at color clock index html you'll see a script tag reading from the src value this script is expecting a folder called node modules in the same directory as the html file inside node modules is another folder moment which contains moment js there is a second script tag in our index html file taking a look inside index js we can see that this script relies on a unique function call moment format 'mmmm do yyyy h mm ss a' our goal is to get this code working we do not need to change index js instead we will need to set up a package json file and install the momentjs package navigate to the project directory the first thing to do is change directory into this folder in your terminal by typing the command cd color clock note the next step will create a package json file in whatever directory you are in which in turn will be where the node modules folder is if you do not change directory into color clock you'll end up creating a file in the main directory of this lesson and color clock index html will be looking for node modules in the wrong directory create a package json file the package json can be written quickly from scratch but we actually have a handy command for creating these files npm init run npm init and you will be prompted to confirm the information that will be stored in package json starting with the name of the project most prompts will provide a default value some are blank and can be left this way for now follow the prompts until the end and a fully constructed package json file will appear in the color clock directory add a script in the process of creating the package json file you wre prompted to write a test script let's add a working script in to see how this works open the newly created package json file and look for a section titled scripts let's replace the default test script with an shell command we can now call this script and have it run by using the command npm test in the terminal if that doesn't work try npm run test you should see a print out of hello world in all the javascript based labs you've encountered so far this sort of script is how we run tests if you look at the test script on previous labs most will have something like this this is actually a command that you can run in the terminal this is a call to the testing package mocha along with a second package mocha multi that helps with reporting when you run learn or learn test in a lab npm test gets called scripts are often useful for things like testing or to start a necessary process like a local server install a package with package json set up we can now add a package we want to include in our project now we're building a colorful clock the project is simple enough that we could build it entirely out of custom code here's the thing though mdash one of the reasons packages exist and are so useful is because programmers often run into the same problems over and over node packages are written so we don't have to re find a solution other programmers have found in the case of a colorful clock we have to deal with formatting time this is such a common problem that a package has been created to help us moment js moment moment js is a handy package that comes with a number of functions that make displaying dates and times simpler than trying to figure out javascripts built in functions let's install moment js and incorporate into our clock to install a package and save it to your package json file run npm install followed by the package name in our case that would be this command will add the package to the list of dependencies in package json when npm install is run all dependencies are installed if you were to publish this repository on github other users would now be able to clone down the repo and install whatever is listed in pakage json to get the program working if package json file has the correct package and the node module has been installed open index html and you should see a colorful clock appear to submit your work in this lesson you'll have to run cd to get back to the main lesson directory before running learn submit conclusion we've departed from the shore and are now afloat on the sea of code when building our own applications we will often rely on existing packages to handle specific pieces of a project although we only installed one package in this lab there are many layers of dependencies for them and many

the box however there are many reasons why you may wish to use it supports distribution of private packages without running a private registry server or paying someone to do so supports distribution of private packages using network or auth based security i e on premise or cloud based supports git url based security authentication mechanisms has a superior versioning representation compared to cdns raw tarballs decentralized point of failure set up your own network of git mirrors as you wish note the best experience for npm packages is still with an official registry server you can find out more about user experience differences for packages installed from git on the official npm git roadmap page design currently for simplicity this package is available only in api form as an api it is currently designed in the following way asynchronous es api also very promise y uses whatever promise implementation is built in to node or globally polyfilled also does exports in es style with its default function being the es default export attached console is designed to run as part of a console ux to help satisfy potential auth prompts interactively during clone and push to run non interactively ensure that you have configured a credential helper intermediate pack in order to provide better compatibility parity with conventional publishing npm git publish actually invokes the official npm pack to create an intermediate tarball and then uses its contents to populate the git based release temporary local clone in order to simplify git integration the implementation creates a shallow clone in your local file system you provide the path computing all of this virtually in memory would be faster but could not find readily available implementations external tools does not reference an implementation of git or npm this makes npm install of this package faster but you will need to ensure compatible versions are locatable on your path install typically you would use this

publish operation to result in a promise that is in the terminal error state if a callback is provided for this option and the default behaviour is requested to generate the tag name or commit text

            "roku deploy publish roku projects to a roku device by using node js build status coverage status monthly downloads npm version license slack installation npm install roku deploy requirements your project must be structured the way that roku expects the source files can be in a subdirectory using the rootdir config option but whever your roku files exist they must align with the following folder structure components images source manifest you should create a rokudeploy json file at the root of your project that contains all of the overrides to the default options roku deploy will auto detect this file and use it when possible note rokudeploy json is jsonc which means it supports comments sample rokudeploy json usage from a node script or copying the files to staging if you'd like to use roku deploy to copy files to a staging folder you can do the following creating a zip from an already populated staging folder use this logic if you'd like to create a zip from your application folder deploying an existing zip if you've already created a zip using some other tool you can use roku deploy to sideload the zip running roku deploy as an npm script from an npm script in package json requires rokudeploy json to exist at the root level where this is being run scripts deploy roku deploy you can provide a callback in any of the higher level methods which allows you to modify the copied contents before the package is zipped an info object is passed in with the following attributes manifestdata key string string contains all the parsed values from the manifest file stagingdir string path to staging folder to make it so you only need to know the relative path to what you're trying to modify bsconfig json another common config file is bsconfig json used by the brighterscript project and the brightscript extension for vscode since many of the config settings are shared between roku deploy json and bsconfig json roku deploy supports reading from that file as well here is the loading order if roku deploy json is found those settings are used if roku deploy json is not found look for bsconfig json and use those settings note that when roku deploy is called from within a nodejs script the options passed into the roku deploy methods will override any options found in roku deploy json and bsconfig json files array the files array is how you specify what files are included in your project any strings found in the files array must be relative to rootdir and are used as include filters meaning that if a file matches the pattern it is included for most standard projects the default files array should work just fine this will copy all files from the standard roku folders directly into the package while maintaining each file's relative file path within rootdir if you want to include additonal files you will need to provide the entire array for example if you have a folder with other assets you could do the following excluding files you can also prefix your file patterns with which will exclude files from the output this is useful in cases where you want everything in a folder except certain files the files array is processed top to bottom here's an example top level string rules all patterns will be resolved relative to rootdir with their relative positions within rootdir maintained no pattern may reference a file outside of rootdir you can use src dest objects to accomplish for example any valid glob pattern is supported see glob on npm for more information empty folders are not copied paths to folders will be ignored if you want to copy a folder and its contents use the glob syntax i e some folder advanced usage for more advanced use cases you may provide an object which contains the source pattern and output path this allows you to get very specific about what files to copy and where they are placed in the output folder this option also supports copying files from outside the project the object structure is as follows src dest object rules if src is a non glob path to a single file then dest should include the filename and extension for example src lib promise promise brs dest source promise brs if src is a glob pattern then dest should be a path to the folder in the output directory for example src lib brs dest source lib if src is a glob pattern that includes then all files found in src after the will retain their relative paths in src when copied to dest for example src lib brs dest source lib if src is a path to a folder it will be ignored if you want to copy a folder and its contents use the glob syntax the following example will copy all files from the lib vendor folder recursively src lib vendor dest vendor if dest is not specified the root of the output folder is assumed collision handling roku deploy processes file entries in order so if you want to override a file just make sure the one you want to keep is later in the files array for example if you have a base project and then a child project that wants to override specific files you could do the following roku deploy options here are the available options the defaults are shown to the right of the option name but all can be overridden host string required the ip address or hostname of the target roku device example password string required the password for logging in to the developer portal on the target roku device signingpassword string required for signing the password used for creating signed packages rekeysignedpackage string required for rekeying path to a copy of the signed package you want to use for rekeying devid string dev id we are expecting the device to have if supplied we check that the dev id returned after keying matches what we expected outdir string out a full path to the folder where the zip pkg package should be placed outfile string roku deploy the base filename the zip pkg file should be given excluding the extension rootdir string ' ' the root path to the folder holding your project the manifest file should be directly underneath this folder use this option when your roku project is in a subdirectory of where roku deploy is installed files string src string dest string an array of file paths globs or src string dest string objects that will be copied into the deployment package using the src dest objects will allow you to move files into different destination paths in the deployment package this would be useful for copying environment specific configs into a common config location i e copy from projectroot configs dev config json to roku deploy zip config json here's a sample this will result in the sourcefolder configs dev config json file being copied to the zip file and named config json you can also provide negated globs thanks to glob all so something like this would include all component files except for specs note if you override this files property you need to provide all config values as your array will completely overwrite the default retainstagingfolder boolean false set this to true to prevent the staging folder from being deleted after creating the package this is helpful for troubleshooting why your package isn't being created the way you expected stagingdir string options outdir roku deploy staging the path to the staging folder where roku deploy places all of the files right before zipping them up

fast really good at concurrency and it will never give you corrupted data even if cache files get corrupted or manipulated it was originally written to be used as npm local cache but can just as easily be used on its own translations espanol readme es md install npm install save cacache table of contents example example features features contributing contributing api api using localized apis

participation there's a bunch of things you can do if you want to contribute the contributor guide contributing md has all the information you need for everything from reporting bugs to contributing entire new features please don't hesitate to jump in if you'd like to or even ask us questions if something isn't clear all participants and maintainers in this project are expected to follow code of conduct code of conduct md and just generally be excellent to each other please refer to the changelog changelog md for project history details too happy hacking api using localized apis cacache includes a complete api in english with the same features as other translations to use the english api as documented in this readme use require 'cacache en' this is also currently the default if you do require 'cacache' but may change in the future cacache also supports other languages you can find the list of currently supported ones by looking in locales in the source directory you can use the api in that language with require 'cacache ' want to add support for a new language please go ahead you should be able to copy locales en js and locales en json and fill them in translating the readme md is a bit more work but also appreciated if you get around to it cacache ls cache promise lists info for all entries currently in the cache as a single large object each entry in the object will be keyed by the unique index key with corresponding get info get info objects as the values example cacache ls stream cache readable lists info for all entries currently in the cache as a single large object this works just like ls ls except get info get info entries are returned as 'data' events on the returned stream example cacache get cache key opts promise data metadata integrity returns an object with the cached data digest and metadata identified by key the data property of this object will be a buffer instance that presumably holds some data that means something to you i'm sure you know what to do with it cacache just won't care integrity is a subresource integrity integrity string that is a string that can be used to verify data which looks like if there is no content identified by key or if the locally stored data does not pass the validity checksum the promise will be rejected a sub function get bydigest may be used for identical behavior except lookup will happen by integrity hash bypassing the index entirely this version of the function only returns data itself without any wrapper note this function loads the entire cache entry into memory before returning it if you're dealing with very large data consider using get stream get stream instead example cacache get stream cache key opts readable returns a readable stream of the cached data identified by key if there is no content identified by key or if the locally stored data does not pass the validity checksum an error will be emitted metadata and integrity events will be emitted before the stream closes if you need to collect that extra data about the cached entry a sub function get stream bydigest may be used for identical behavior except lookup will happen by integrity hash bypassing the index entirely this version does not emit the metadata and integrity events at all example cacache get info cache key promise looks up key in the cache index returning information about the entry if one exists fields key key the entry was looked up under matches the key argument integrity subresource integrity hash integrity for the content this entry refers to path filesystem path where content is stored joined with cache argument time timestamp the entry was first added on metadata user assigned metadata associated with the entry content example cacache get hascontent cache integrity promise looks up a subresource integrity hash integrity in the cache if content exists for this integrity it will return an object with the specific single integrity hash that was found in sri key and the size of the found content as size if no content exists for this integrity it will return false example cacache put cache key data opts promise inserts data passed to it into the cache the returned promise resolves with a digest generated according to opts algorithms optsalgorithms after the cache entry has been successfully written example cacache put stream cache key opts writable returns a writable stream that inserts data written to it into the cache emits an integrity event with the digest of written contents when it succeeds example cacache put options cacache put functions have a number of options in common opts metadata arbitrary metadata to be attached to the inserted key opts size if provided the data stream will be verified to check that enough data was passed through if there's more or less data than expected insertion will fail with an ebadsize error opts integrity if present the pre calculated digest for the inserted content if this option if provided and does not match the post insertion digest insertion will fail with an eintegrity error algorithms has no effect if this option is present opts algorithms default 'sha ' hashing algorithms to use when calculating the subresource integrity digest integrity for inserted data can use any algorithm listed in crypto gethashes or 'omakase' '' to pick a random hash algorithm on each insertion you may also use any anagram of 'modnar' to use this feature currently only supports one algorithm at a time i e an array length of exactly has no effect if opts integrity is present opts uid opts gid if provided cacache will do its best to make sure any new files added to the cache use this particular uid gid combination this can be used for example to drop permissions when someone uses sudo but cacache makes no assumptions about your needs here opts memoize default null if provided cacache will memoize the given cache insertion in memory bypassing any filesystem checks for that key or digest in future cache fetches nothing will be written to the in memory cache unless this option is explicitly truthy if opts memoize is an object or a map like that is an object with get and set methods it will be written to instead of the global memoization cache reading from disk data can be forced by explicitly passing memoize false to the reader functions but their default will be to read from memory cacache rm all cache promise clears the entire cache mainly by blowing away the cache directory itself example cacache rm entry cache key promise alias cacache rm removes the index entry for key content will still be accessible if requested directly by content address get stream bydigest get stream to remove the content itself which might still be used by other entries use rm content rm content or to safely vacuum any unused content use verify verify example cacache rm content cache integrity promise removes the content identified by integrity any index entries referring to it will not be usable again until the content is re added to the cache with an identical digest example cacache setlocale locale configure the language locale used for messages and errors coming from cacache the list of available locales is in the locales directory in the project root interested in contributing more languages submit a pr contributing md cacache clearmemoized completely resets the in memory entry cache tmp mkdir cache opts promise returns a unique temporary directory inside the cache's tmp dir this directory will use the same safe user assignment that all the other stuff use once the directory is made it's the user's responsibility that all files within are made according to the same opts gid opts uid settings that would be passed in if not you can ask cacache to do it for you by calling tmp fix tmp fix which will fix all tmp directory permissions if you want automatic cleanup of this directory use tmp withtmp with tpm example tmp withtmp cache opts cb promise creates a temporary directory with tmp mkdir tmp mkdir and calls cb with it the created temporary directory will be removed when the return value of cb resolves that is if you return a promise from cb the tmp directory will be automatically deleted once that promise completes the same caveats apply when it comes to managing permissions for the tmp dir's contents example subresource integrity digests for content verification and addressing cacache uses strings following the subresource integrity spec that is any time cacache expects an integrity argument or option it should be in the format one deviation from the current spec is that cacache will support any hash algorithms supported by the underlying node js process you can use crypto gethashes to see which ones you can use generating digests yourself if you have an existing content shasum they are generally formatted as a hexadecimal string that is a sha would look like f f fdbe af b d d dcf c e in order to be compatible with cacache you'll need to convert this to an equivalent subresource integrity string for this example the corresponding hash would be sha x ut iiv uuwvm znjzcnz xg if you want to generate an integrity string yourself for existing data you can use something like this you can also use ssri to have a richer set of functionality around sri strings including generation parsing and translating from existing hex formatted strings cacache verify cache opts promise checks out and fixes up your cache cleans up corrupted or invalid index entries custom entry filtering options garbage collects any content entries not referenced by the index checks integrity for all content entries and removes invalid content fixes cache ownership removes the tmp directory in the cache and all its contents when it's done it'll return an object with various stats about the verification process including amount of storage reclaimed number of valid entries number of entries removed etc options opts uid uid to assign to cache and its contents opts gid gid to assign to cache and its contents opts filter receives a formatted entry return false to remove it note might be called more than once on the same entry example cacache verify lastrun cache promise returns a date representing the last time cacache verify was run on cache example\n",

            "npm github example and demo registry to allow for npm to install package directly from github works for public and private repositories why private npm registries are cool they are often cumbersome to setup and are a bit of an overkill right now since your sourcecode already lives on github why not just install directly from github using npm the problem with the current support for github in npm is that it doesn't work well for private repos to download private repos you have to use the less elegant git ssh uri syntax and make your package json files look terrible to solve these issues and provide a cheap both in cost and complexity solution to installing from github via npm an npm registry proxy can be used previously you would need to proxy all requests through this fake registry but with the addition of the scopes this can actually be done on a per organization or user level and also makes installing private repos as modules much simpler setup you need to use npm v for the scopes features the easiest way to do this without messing up your existing install is to use the npm next module install it globally as shown below and run it whenever you would normally run the npm cli command configure npm npm needs to be told where to find our scoped modules in our example we are going to download a module from my personal github account to educate npm about how to handle defunctzombie scope add the following to your home npmrc file this tells npm that whenever it sees a module that starts with defunctzombie to download it from the npm github herokuapp com registry and not the default main npm registry the same process is used for organizations install a scoped module i have created a demo scoped module to test your setup run the command below notice that this module scope test and its dependency do not live on the npm registry but are downloaded via the demo proxy and installed as regular modules if everything is configured correctly you should see the following output if you wish to add the scoped module to your app's package json simply use the full scoped name as the module name private repositories if you have a private github repository and wish to install that as an npm module the registry proxy supports that too one benefit to the approach used here is that you can continue using github to manage user access to your repositories without configuring another permission system first you need to create an oauth token using whatever github account has access to the private repo you wish to install follow these instructions from github then once again edit your npmrc file and add the following lines after the existing defunctzombie line note you will need these lines under every user or org that has private repos you wish to install these credentials will be sent to the heroku demo app which will use them to grant access to the private repository that's it you can now install any private repo your user account has access to via npm for ci systems simply make a ci github user and token with only the repo access you need note while i am not storing any github auth tokens please run your own copy of the registry code for any serious use the heroku app is only a demo gotchas and tips you must tag the version in github before you can install it\n",

            "npmgitdev npmgitdev a wrapper around npm version that allows you to work with git repos cloned directly into node modules when we're developing modular software we often need to edit multiple separate npm packages simultaneously the official way to do this is with npm link we clone a separate repo for each package and then link it into the appropriate places the problem is npm link creates all sorts of complexities and bugs it would be nice if we could avoid all this complexity by simply cloning a repo into node modules unfortunately npm install will bail refuse to do anything when it detects a git directory inside any package in node modules npmgitdev avoids this problem by ensuring that all git repos are clean have no changes in the working directory or index so that if npm decides to replace the package you won't lose any work temporarily changing the required version to match the one specified in the git repo's package json so npm is not inclined to mess with it temporarily copying all devdependencies of git packages to dependencies because you'll probably need them while you're developing your git package hiding the git directory temporarily while invoking an npm command cleaning up all the temporary changes after the git command completes installation usage the end result is that npm installs packages exactly as it would if you copied all your devdependencies to dependencies and then published the package to npm npm's package deduplication actually works unlike with npm link if you accidentally run npm install instead it should be harmless because npm will bail when it sees your git directory questions and answers what happens if my git package is referenced from multiple other packages in my dependency tree generally you should clone your git package into the top level node modules directory of your application then npmgitdev will ensure that npm keeps it there by adding a dependency in the top level package json to that exact version of the package if other packages elsewhere in the dependency tree depend on a semver compatible version of that package npm 's deduplication wil avoid installing any other copies of that package elsewhere in the tree however if other packages depend on an incompatible version of that package or if their dependency is to a git url or something else other than a version npm will install additional copies if you instead intended for all packages to share the git repo version of the package you simply need to delete the extra copies that npm installed use npmgitdev list to see what versions exist in your dependency tree dependencies npm and node\n",

get an unexpected result but you can pass a second argument with options with usefirstrowforheadings true to have it treat the first column as it would any other cell tables with html the following options are true by default which converts all values to plain text to give you an easier more readable object to work with striphtmlfromheadings striphtmlfromcells if your table contains html you want to parse for example for links you can set striphtmlfromcells to false to treat it as raw text note this doesn't work with nested tables which it will still try to parse you probably don't need to set striphtmlfromheadings to false and setting it to false can make the results hard to parse but if you do you can also set both at the same time by setting striphtml to false options attention

weird results on tables that have complex structures such as nested tables or multiple headers such as on both x and y axis you'll need to handle things like work out which tables to parse and in most cases clean up the data you might want to combine it it with modules like json csv or csvtomarkdowntable you might want to use it with a module like 'cheerio' if you want to parse specific tables identified by id or class i e select them with cheerio and pass the html of them as a string example usage issues right now the table needs to be well formatted to be convertable tables in tables with not be processed contributing improvements fixes and suggestions for better written modules that other people have created are welcome as are bug reports against specific tables it is unable to handle

vs code extensions es lint and prettier in the vs code top menu terminal new terminal install dependencies install dependencies with npm write your code make necessary changes in package json name version description keywords author homepage and other urls write your code in src folder and unit test in test folder replacing the original files there the vs code shortcuts for formatting of a code file are shift alt f windows shift option alt f macos ctrl shift i linux change code linting and formatting settings in prettierrc js if you want test test your code with jest framework note example

elsewhere you don't even need to npm init to generate package json open the folder with vs code open a terminal and just run this will create a symbolic link from globally installed example typescript package to node modules of the current folder you can then create a for example testnum ts file with the content if you don't see any linting errors in vs code if you put your mouse cursor over num and see its type then it's all good whenever you want to uninstall the globally installed example typescript package and remove the symlink in the global folder run prepare to publish create an npm account click to read this section if you do manual publishing manual publishing to npm log in and publish this package is configured to use github actions ci cd to automate both the npm and github packages publishing process the following are what you have to do ci publishing to npm follow npm's official instruction to create an npm token choose publish from the website or use npm token create without argument with the cli if you use fa then make sure it's enabled for authorization only instead of authorization and publishing edit profile modify fa on the page of your newly created or existing github repo click settings secrets new repository secret the name should be npm token and the value should be your npm token ci publishing to github packages the default configuration of this example package assumes you publish package with an unscoped name to npm github packages must be named with a scope name such as tomchen example typescript package change scope ' tomchen' to your own scope in github workflows publish yml also change addscope in package json if you publish package with a scoped name to npm change the name to something like tomchen example typescript package in package json and remove the run npm run addscope line in github workflows publish yml if you publish your package to npm only and don't want to publish to github packages then delete the lines from name setup npmrc file to publish to github packages to the end of the file in github workflows publish yml you might have noticed secret github token in github workflows publish yml you don't need to set up a secret named github token actually it is automatically created publish now everything is set the example package has automated tests and upload publishing already set up with github actions every time you git push or a pull request is submitted on your master or main branch the package is automatically tested against the desired os and node js versions with github actions every time an annotated not lightweight v tag is pushed onto github a github release is automatically generated from this version it also automatically publishes to the npm registry and or github packages registry to update the package there npm version yarn version is useful to create tags npm or yarn v not yarn v you could also add postversion git push follow tags to package json file to push it automatically after npm or yarn version yarn v not v because yarn version doesn't check whether there are uncommitted changes you can add preversion git diff index quiet head to package json note preversion postversion doesn't work in yarn v for npm registry you can unpublish a version or the whole package but can never re publish the same version under the same name if you want to modify the description readme on the npm package page you have to publish a new version you can modify the description on github packages without publishing notes it uses npm but you can easily switch to yarn of course remember to change all npm in scripts in the file package json whether you use npm as your package manager whether you can publish to the npm registry works fine in vs code in my configuration eslintrc and prettierrc cooperate perfectly see scripts in package json for other predefined script commands pinst is used to solve a problem of husky the installation of the package with npm yarn v

format works for both version bumping and the show version operations of the cli the commit and tag can be disabled via the skip vcs option a completely dry run where nothing will be changed but the new version number is output can be enabled with the dry run switch performing a dry run also implies skip vcs if the current directory does not contain the csproj file to work on the f project file switch can be provided installing the cli tool to install the tool simply issue now it should be available as it can also be executed directly as dotnet version both should produce output similar to using json output will produce the product bit is information about the cli tool itself standard workflow you have just merged a pr with a bugfix onto master and you are ready to release a new version of your library application the workflow is then pre release workflow as mentioned in the introduction the version tool allows working with pre releases let's assume you have a library in version and have made merges to master you are not sure these changes work in the wild and therefore you require a pre release in the simpelest form you can to get a preminor out this new version tag would become next if additional changes are merged you can roll over the pre release version number by to make the release next when ready you can snap out of pre release mode and deploy the final minor version resulting in the version all other command line flags like f apply and you can also include build meta as per semver spec like so to have a resulting version string like next abcedf if the default next prefix is not desired it can easily be changed using the prefix switch like so resulting in beta possible ci workflow if you do not care that commits and tags are made with the current version of your library but simply wish to bump the version of your software when building on master the tool can be used as powershell example replacing build id with whatever variable your build environment injects the total count of commits in your git repo can also be used as a build number change commit message if you want to change defaults commit message you can use the flag m or message there are variables availables to be set in the message projname will be replaced for package title or package id if its not defined oldver will be replaced for old version of the package newver will be replaced for new version of the package change tag message if you want to change defaults tag message you can use the flag t or tag there are variables availables to be set in the tag projname will be replaced for package title or package id if its not defined oldver will be replaced for old version of the package newver will be replaced for new version of the package common version if you want to share a version across multiple csproj files you can create a targets file and import import it in the csproj files common targets and in your csproj files you can then use dotnet version to change the version in common targets nuget image nuget url semver sonarqubelink sonarqualitylogo sonarcoveragelogo sonarvulnerabilitieslogo sonarbugslogo sonarcodesmellslogo import\n",
